# Weighted Mixed Distance (WMD) [`[paper]`](https://github.com/aungpyaeap)

**Paper title: A Distance Metric for Clustering Mixed Data Using Graph-Based Feature Influence Balancing Approach**

This repository presents the **Weighted Mixed Distance (WMD)** metric, an approach for clustering datasets containing both numerical and categorical features. WMD improves clustering quality by adjusting feature influence using a graph-based unsupervised method.

## Example of use
MATLAB code `wmd(X, W_R, W_C)` function returns $n \times n$ symmetric matrix.
```m
dataPoints = readtable('medical-insurance.csv', VariableNamingRule='preserve');
[weightNumerical, weightCategorical] = getweights(dataPoints);
DIST = wmd(dataPoints, weightNumerical, weightCategorical);
disp(DIST);
```
